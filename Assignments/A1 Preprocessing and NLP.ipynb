Notebooks are great in cases where you want to interleave code and text, e.g. when you want to perform a data analysis and provide some commentary of the findings along the side. They are not so great for production-level systems, e.g. when you work for a company and are tasked with designing a component to perform some textual analytics task. For these purposes, scripts should be used. In later assignments, we'll also use those, but for now, notebooks are ideal. With growing experience, you'll get a feeling for when each tool is appropriate.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q: I get the output message 'Not all tweets were loaded', what am I doing wrong?** \\\\\n",
        "A: Sometimes after reloading the notebook in Colab, not the entire data file is uploaded. Make sure to check whether it is correctly uploaded, and if needed reupload. Another possibility is that the file contains a character that for some reason is not handled correctly on your computer. This doesn't happen often, but you can check at which tweet your load_data function stopped parsing and manually inspect the tweet to remove/alter the character.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: I think I did a task correctly, but the assert tells me I don't have the correct number of tweets left, what am I doing wrong?** \\\\\n",
        "A: Most likely, you have a code that indeed works properly, but that does not satisfy the exact given requirements of the task. Please reread the task and check whether you satisfy the requirements exactly as proposed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: I have strange bugs in the base code you provided, what do I do?** \\\\\n",
        "A: This most likely has to do with settings specific to your local machine and/or python/library versions. All our code has been implemented and tested using [Google Colab](https://https://colab.research.google.com/), because this is relatively hassle-free. Please consider switching in case you experience such problems. We can try to help you out on other platforms, but cannot guarantee that we can solve it. The problems should be solved automatically when switching to Colab!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: Plotly 4.0.0 won't install on my local machine, how can I fix this?** \\\\\n",
        "A: In case you're running the assignment locally and you get the error that it could not find a version that satisfies the requirement, try removing the apostrophes around 4.0.0. Another solution may be to first run 'uninstall plotly' and then run the code to install plotly 4.0.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: The provided code for extract_and_add_ngrams is raising an error, how can I solve this?** \\\\\n",
        "A: Sometimes, the function extract_and_add_ngrams raises errors on local machines due to the use of multiprocessing. Switching to Colab should automatically solve the issue without changing the code. In case you do not want to do so, you can replace the given function with the following code:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q: The function for extracting and plotting n-grams runs infinitely and never terminates with output, what do I do?** \\\\\n",
        "A: Sometimes, running on your local machine may result in this. In the past, a reason has been computing power. Try lowering the parameter n. In case this does not work, please consider moving to Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q: I get a different number of tweets every time I load the data, what is happening?** \\\\\n",

        "**Q: My function for duplicate detection detects 17717 duplicates, what am I missing?** \\\\\n",
