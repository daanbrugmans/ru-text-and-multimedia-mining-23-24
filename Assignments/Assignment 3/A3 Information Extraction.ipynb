      "Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto, before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023 citing concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.\n",
      "\n",
      "With David Rumelhart and Ronald J. Williams, Hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularised the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. Hinton is viewed as a leading figure in the deep learning community. The dramatic image-recognition milestone of the AlexNet designed in collaboration with his students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever for the ImageNet challenge 2012 was a breakthrough in the field of computer vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hinton received the 2018 Turing Award (often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\"), together with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. They are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\", and have continued to give public talks together.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2023, Hinton announced his resignation from Google to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of A.I.\" He has voiced concerns about deliberate misuse by malicious actors, technological unemployment, and existential risk from artificial general intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hinton was educated at King's College, Cambridge. After repeatedly changing his degree between different subjects like natural sciences, history of art, and philosophy, he eventually graduated in 1970 with a bachelor of arts in experimental psychology. He continued his study at the University of Edinburgh where he was awarded a PhD in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by Christopher Longuet-Higgins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hinton's research concerns ways of using neural networks for machine learning, memory, perception, and symbol processing. He has written or co-written more than 200 peer reviewed publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hinton co-invented Boltzmann machines with David Ackley and Terry Sejnowski. His other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations, time delay neural network, mixtures of experts, Helmholtz machines and Product of Experts. In 2007, Hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled Unsupervised learning of image transformations. An accessible introduction to Geoffrey Hinton's research can be found in his articles in Scientific American in September 1992 and October 1993.\n",

      "Yoshua Bengio OC FRS FRSC (born March 5, 1964]) is a Canadian computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks and deep learning. He is a professor at the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research at the Université de Montréal and scientific director of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bengio received the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award (often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\"), together with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, for their work on deep learning. Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun, are sometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of Deep Learning\". As of May 2023, he is the most cited computer scientist by h-index.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bengio was born in France to a Jewish family who immigrated to France from Morocco, and then immigrated again to Canada. He received his Bachelor of Science degree (electrical engineering), MSc (computer science) and PhD (computer science) from McGill University.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bengio brothers lived in Morocco for a year during their father's military service there. His father, Carlo Bengio, was a pharmacist who wrote theatre pieces and ran a Sephardic theatrical troupe in Montreal that played Judeo-Arabic pieces. His mother, Célia Moreno, is also an artist who played in one of the major theatre scenes of Morocco that was run by Tayeb Seddiki in the 1970s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Career and research.\n",
      "\n",
      "After his PhD, Bengio was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT (supervised by Michael I. Jordan) and AT&T Bell Labs. Bengio has been a faculty member at the Université de Montréal since 1993 and is co-director of the Learning in Machines & Brains program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is considered by Cade Metz as one of the three people most responsible for the advancement of deep learning during the 1990s and 2000s. Among the computer scientists with an h-index of at least 100, Bengio was as of 2018 the one with the most recent citations per day, according to MILA.  As of December 2022, he had the 2nd highest Discipline H-index (D-index) in computer science. Thanks to a 2019 article on a novel RNN architecture, Bengio has an Erdős number of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Views on AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following concerns raised by AI experts about the existential risks AI poses on humanity, in May 2023, Bengio stated in an interview to BBC that he felt \"lost\" over his life's work. He raised his concern about \"bad actors\" getting hold of AI, especially as it becomes more sophisticated and powerful. He called for better regulation, product registration, ethical training, and more involvement from governments in tracking and auditing AI products. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking with the Financial Times also in May 2023, Bengio said that he supported the monitoring of access to AI systems such as ChatGPT so that potentially illegal or dangerous uses could be tracked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awards and honours.\n",
      "\n",
